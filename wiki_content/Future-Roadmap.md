# Future Roadmap

## The Vision
To build a directory that is not just a list, but a vibrant ecosystem for the Malaysian Amateur Radio community, while maintaining our "Zero-Cost" sustainability promise.

## Planned Improvements

### 1. 📧 Enterprise Email Service
*   **Goal**: Re-enable the License Expiry Reminder system.
*   **Challenge**: The current free tier allows only 100 emails/day.
*   **Solution**: We are looking for sponsors to fund a reliable email service (AWS SES or dedicated SMTP) to reliably send thousands of reminders without quota issues.

### 2. 🛡️ Automated Data Verification
*   **Goal**: Zero manual approvals.
*   **Method**: Build a Python scraper/bot that can cross-reference submitted data directly against the MCMC Public Register.
*   **Benefit**: Instant approval for valid callsigns and automatic rejection of fake submissions.

### 3. 🗺️ Repeater Map Integration
*   **Goal**: A visual map of all repeaters in Malaysia.
*   **Features**:
    *   Filter by Band (2m/70cm).
    *   Distance calculation (Show nearest repeaters to your grid).
    *   Status reporting (Up/Down).

### 4. 📱 Native Mobile Apps
*   **Goal**: Publish to Apple App Store and Google Play Store.
*   **Tech**: Wrap the current PWA using Capacitor or React Native.
*   ** Offline Mode**: Allow the entire database to be downloaded for use in deep jungle/emergency operations.
