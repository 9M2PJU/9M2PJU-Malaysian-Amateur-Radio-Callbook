# About the Project

## 📖 Introduction
The **Malaysian Amateur Radio Callbook** (MY-Callbook) is a modern, digital directory for Amateur Radio operators in Malaysia. Unlike traditional paper callbooks or static PDF lists, MY-Callbook is a dynamic, searchable, and interactive platform that runs in the cloud.

It serves as a central hub where operators can:
*   **Verify identities**: Check if a callsign is active or expired.
*   **Connect**: Find contact details (Standard Operating Procedures apply) for QSL exchanges.
*   **Showcase**: Build a customized digital profile with social links.

## 🕰️ History & Origin Story
This project was initiated by **9M2PJU** (Faizul) with a singular vision: to modernize the Malaysian Ham Radio landscape without imposing costs on the community.

### The Problem
For years, the community relied on specialized WhatsApp groups, scattered PDFs, or outdated Excel sheets to find operator details. There was no single, unified, privacy-respected, and easily accessible source of truth that worked well on mobile phones.

### The Solution ("The Zero-Cost Promise")
In 2024-2025, 9M2PJU architected a solution using the "Zero-Cost" stack:
*   **Frontend**: Using **React** and **Vite** for a fast, app-like experience (PWA).
*   **Backend**: Leveraging **Supabase** (an open-source Firebase alternative) for its generous free tier.
*   **Hosting**: Using **Vercel** Edge Network for global verified delivery.

This architecture ensures that the project does not require monthly subscriptions or server rental fees, ensuring its longevity even if funding is unavailable.

## 🎯 Project Goals
1.  **Sustainability**: To run forever on free-tier infrastructure.
2.  **Accessibility**: To be accessible on any device (Mobile, Tablet, Desktop) even on slow connections (2G/EDGE).
3.  **Community Driven**: To allow the community to maintain the data themselves via self-service portals.
